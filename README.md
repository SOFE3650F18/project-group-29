# Software Design and Architectures
**Prepared by:** Dr. Ramiro Liscano  
**Course Code:** SOFE 3650  

# Deliverables
The expectation is to submit a document that demonstrates the ADD steps as applied to the design of an architecture for a Course Management System (CMS). The deliverables are divided into 2 submissions. The first submission is part of a question in assignment 2 which includes capturing the use cases, quality attributes and constraint requirements of the CMS and is submitted prior to the CMS design stage that is part of the deliverables of the project.


 - First Deliverable
 - First Iteration
 - Second Iteration
 - Third Iteration
 
# Input Review
The CMS described is a greenfield system from a mature domain. As the first step of the ADD process is not stepped through except in the case of the first iteration, this step is described in the README file.

### Design Purpose
The purpose is to produce a system design that is sufficiently detailed to support the future construction of the system.
